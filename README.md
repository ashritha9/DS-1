Based on the output generated after the application of “Random Forest” algorithm,we have observed that efficiency of the product delivery majorly depends upon the number of deliveries.Though remaining features do effect but it contributes more for the differences.Because the number of deliveries can be decreased by some feature and can be increased by some other feature that can be the mode of transportation or weather conditions or anything.
